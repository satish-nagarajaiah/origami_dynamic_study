# origami_dynamic_study
This repository contains the recorded video, processed video, and the results of simulations and experiments for Dynamic Behavior of Origami Structures: Computational and Experimental Study by Sudheendra Herkal, Satish Nagarajaiah and Glaucio Paulino, submitted to Proceedings of Royal Society A journal.


Variables in dynamic_simulations_results.mat:
check_nodes: Nodes highlighted Figure 25 of the manuscript
exp_disp: Experimental displacement time-series along longitudinal direction for the nodes highlighted in Figure 25 
exp_time: Time for the experimental displacements
sim_disp: Numerical displacement time-series along longitudinal direction for the nodes highlighted in Figure 25 
sim_time: Time for the numerical displacements
sim_disp_full: Full field numerical state variable time-series along all the three directions (arranged as [1x;1y;1z;.....;nx;ny;nz;1vx;1vy;1vz;....;nvx;nvy;nvz], where the number indicates node, x,y and z are displacements in respective directions and vx, vy and vz are velocities in the respective directions)
